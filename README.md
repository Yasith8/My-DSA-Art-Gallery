This is my Learning Journey about Data Structure and Algorithm

##***What is Data Structure and Algorithem?***

When we talking about DSA, Data Structures are a containers that capable to storing in a computer.Data structures provide a framework for storing and organizing data in a way that makes it easy to access, modify, and manipulate. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables, among others. Each data structure has its own strengths and weaknesses, making it suitable for different types of problems and operations.
